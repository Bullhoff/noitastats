# NoitaStats

The main purpose of this program is to sync the save files (player.xml and world_state.xml) to a new folder to give a overview of previously played games. 
Save files are only generated when restarting the game. 

Only tested with the steam version on Windows 10 but it should work fine on the nonsteam version as well. If any issues, go to the generated data/config.json and ensure that the paths are correct. 

Requires unpacking data.wak if you want to see images.
